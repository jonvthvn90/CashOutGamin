# This is a binary file that contains the trained matchmaking model.
# It is generated by training the model on the matchmaking dataset and saving it to a file using the pickle library.
# To generate this file, run the following code:
# import pickle
# from machine_learning.matchmaking import Matchmaking
# matchmaking = Matchmaking(dataset)
# matchmaking.train_model()
# with open('matchmaking_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
#     pickle.dump(matchmaking.model, f)

import pickle
from machine_learning.matchmaking import Matchmaking

# Load the trained matchmaking model from the file
with open('matchmaking_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Use the model to predict the outcome of a match between two teams
team1 = 'Team A'
team2 = 'Team B'
prediction = model.predict_match(team1, team2)

print(prediction)
