# This is a binary file that contains the trained matchmaking model.
# It is generated by training the model on the matchmaking dataset and saving it to a file using the pickle library.
# To generate this file, run the following code:
# import pickle
# from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
# from matchmaking_dataset import load_dataset
# dataset = load_dataset()
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(dataset.drop('winner', axis=1), dataset['winner'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
# model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
# model.fit(X_train, y_train)
# y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
# print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
# with open('matchmaking_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
#     pickle.dump(model, f)
